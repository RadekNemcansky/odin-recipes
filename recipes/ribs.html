        <h2>YOU WILL NEED</h2>
        <h3>RIBS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 to 2 1/2 pounds baby back pork ribs</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>SWEET AND SPICY BARBECUE SAUCE</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup finely diced onion</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon hot chili sauce (suggestion Sriracha)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>Salt and ground pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Prepare Ribs</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 275° Fahrenheit (135C).</li>
            <li>If the ribs still have the thin membrane covering the back of the rack, remove it. See how in the notes section below.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of the ribs with a generous amount of salt and pepper. If you are using a spice rub, add season the ribs with it now. Place the ribs, meat-side up, into a large roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet. (It may be necessary to cut the ribs in half for them to fit into the pan).</li>
            <li>Cover the pan or baking sheet tightly with aluminum foil, and then bake until the meat falls easily from the bones, 2 ½ to 3 ½ hours.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>MAKE BARBECUE SAUCE</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>While the ribs bake, make the barbecue sauce. Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the onions and cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the cumin and cook for an additional 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add the ketchup, hot chili sauce, brown sugar, and apple cider vinegar. Stir to combine, season with salt then cook for 2 minutes. Set aside in preparation for the ribs to finish roasting.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>TO FINISH</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the ribs from the oven, discard the aluminum foil and generously brush both sides with barbecue sauce.</li>
            <li>Optional: Move an oven rack near the top of the oven. Turn broiler to high and broil the ribs for 3-4 minutes, just until the barbecue sauce begins to caramelize. (Keep a close eye on the ribs while they broil so the sauce does not burn.)</li>

        </ol>
        <h3>STORING AND REHEATING</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Store baked ribs, in an airtight container, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Freeze, wrapped in foil or freezer paper and in an airtight container, for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator, and then reheat.</li>
            <li>To reheat the ribs, wrap in foil or parchment paper and place into a 300°F oven until warmed through, about 30 minutes. If you have some leftover, slather some extra sauce that’s been warmed over the ribs before serving.</li>
